Explain Simple Linear Regression?

Ans:- Simple Linear Regression is a fundamental statistical technique used to model and analyze the relationship between two variables. Specifically, it aims to describe how a dependent variable (response or target) changes as an independent variable (predictor or feature) varies. The relationship is modeled using a straight line, hence the term "linear."

Key Concepts
Dependent Variable (Y):

The variable you are trying to predict or explain.
Independent Variable (X):

The variable you are using to make predictions or explain the variation in the dependent variable.
Linear Relationship:

The relationship between X and Y is assumed to be linear, which can be expressed by the equation of a straight line:
𝑌
=
𝛽
0
+
𝛽
1
𝑋
+
𝜖
Y=β 
0
​
 +β 
1
​
 X+ϵ
Where:
𝑌
Y is the dependent variable.
𝑋
X is the independent variable.
𝛽
0
β 
0
​
  is the intercept (the value of 
𝑌
Y when 
𝑋
X is 0).
𝛽
1
β 
1
​
  is the slope (the change in 
𝑌
Y for a one-unit change in 
𝑋
X).
𝜖
ϵ is the error term (the difference between the observed and predicted values of 
𝑌
Y).
Objectives of Simple Linear Regression
Estimate the coefficients 
𝛽

​
  and 
𝛽

β

​
 :
Determine the best-fitting line through the data points.
Predict 
𝑌
Y given 
𝑋
X:
Use the linear relationship to predict values of the dependent variable based on new observations of the independent variable.
Evaluate the strength and significance of the relationship:
Assess how well the independent variable explains the variation in the dependent variable.
Estimating the Coefficients
The coefficients 
𝛽

β

​
  and 
𝛽

β

​
  are estimated using the least squares method, which minimizes the sum of the squared differences between the observed values and the values predicted by the linear model.

  is the predicted value of the dependent variable.

Assessing the Model
Coefficient of Determination (R²):

Measures the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variable.
0

𝑅

0≤R 
2
 ≤1, with higher values indicating a better fit.
Residual Analysis:

Examining the residuals (differences between observed and predicted values) to check for patterns that might suggest model inadequacies.
Statistical Significance:

Hypothesis testing on the coefficients (e.g., using t-tests) to determine if the relationship observed is statistically significant.
